# freetheelectorate
Processing and Visualization of Ontario Provincial Election Data. Shows data from 2011 and 2014 provincial elections by Electoral District and Polling Division, and allows users to see elector turnout data, as well as electee results data.

Check it out here: https://mackeynichols.github.io/freetheelectorate/ 

NOTE: This viz uses a large, hairy dataset that github has (graciously) hosted for free. The map requires a few seconds before it's 100% operational.

### Might-Dos
- Add a better, dynamic legend with more detail
- Add equal quartile/count distribution symbology to add emphasis on distinctions within the province
- Fix "PD layers not going away" bug, and uncaught encoding issues with PREO's data
- Add charts to emphasize how a PD contributed to the ED's end results
- DREAM: connect electees to external profiles, with pictures, history, etc
